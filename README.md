# digital_systems_vhdl
<br>
This is a repository of digital systems' projects described using VHDL, written and simulated using Xilinx ISE WebPack. <br>
Some of them will also be tested on FPGA: they're still initially written in Xilinx ISE and then imported in Vivado. <br>
The design of modular digital systems is interesting also for software developers because it has many things in common with software engineering, and the effort spent in that design deals with concerns of timing, concurrency and events. <br>
After all, if you want to be a good software developer, you have to be a software engineer: keep in mind that "engineer" is the noun, and "software" is the qualifier.
